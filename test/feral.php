<DIV STYLE="margin-left:2px; margin-right:50px; text-align:justify">
IF you are feeding feral or feral cats that live outside, <A HREF="index.php?action=charlie">Charlie</A> would like to invite you to join a support group for the exchange of information and services.
<P>The Feral Cat Support Group has started with the TNR (trap-neuter-return) program, which is called <A HREF="index.php?action=gallery&show=event&id=1">Mad Cat Mondays</A> (formerly Wild Cat Wednesdays).
<BR>We have had many very successful Mat Cat Mondays/Wild Cat Wednesdays so far, with the first one on July 16, 2008. Volunteers along with skilled vet technicians and Veterinarians have trapped spayed neutered and returned more than 30 cats.  
<P>The Feral Support Group meets the first monday night of every month.
