<H1 align=center>The No Kill Philosophy</H1>
There has been a lot of discussions and i find myself wanting to not get lost in the labels of hiding behind definitions and what has come to mind is best said by Nathan Winograd which i'll quote from the no kill advocacy site:
<P>
<H3>"Welcome to the Kobayashi Maru, the no-win scenario.</H3>
<P>
"The Kobayashi Maru is a test in Star Trek. It is a Starfleet training exercise designed to test cadets at Starfleet Academy as to how they would react in a no-win scenario. In other words, no one survives the Kobayashi Maru and it was specifically designed that way, by then-Commander Spock. But cadet James T. Kirk beats it because he reprograms it. In other words, he redefines the problem. And just like Kirk, if we are going to win the no-win hypothetical which is set up to "prove" the impossibility of No Kill, we too have to redefine the problem.
<P>
"It is not uncommon for those who kill animals to offer their own Kobayashi Maru hypotheticals because they do not want an answer, they do not want assistance, and they do not want real solutions to real problems. In other words, the person who sent this was not really interested in finding out what to do, but to "prove" No Kill was impossible: they already do everything, they try everything, but nothing works, no one cares, and killing is inevitable. What they want is absolution for the failure to save lives and I won't give it." and he goes on to say "In short, I beat the Kobayashi Maru. And so can you, each and every time, if you take a cue from Captain Kirk."
<P>
When someone offers you a no-win scenario to justify killing, don't play the game. It is rigged against you. You have to refuse, like Captain Kirk, to give in to no-win scenarios by redefining the problem.
<P>
We need to stop the killing, it is our community and people are wanting to do better and we need to do better! A 70% kill rate at our humane society is not good enough!
<P>The following are all important points taken from Nathan Winograd, director of the no kill advocacy centre... "and behind every revolution is a declaration - a statement of grievances , and a list of rights and principles that underscore our great hope for the future.
<P>
Guiding principles:  no kill is achieved only by guaranteeing the following:
<UL>
	<LI>Life to all healthy animals, and to all sick, injured, or vicious animals where medical or behavioural intervention would alter a poor or grave prognosis
	<LI>The right of feral cats to live in their habitats."
</ul>
<P>And also described in his two books,  here are some of the no kill standards:
<UL>
	<LI>An end to the policy of accepting trapped feral cats to be destroyed as unadoptable
	<LI>Implementation of TNR as the accepted method of feral cat control by educating the public about TNR and offering TNR program services
	<LI>The repeal of unenforceable and counter productive animal control ordinances such as cat licensing and leash laws, pet limit laws, bans on feeding stray animals, and bans on specific breeds.
	<LI>Sanctuaries are vital, and their importance is going to continue to grow. 
	<LI>Lastly, grassroots No Kill activists are re-orienting the humane movement away from control and killing, and back to compassion and life-saving.  We have rejected the excuses.
</ul>
