My name is Charlie.  I am utmost in compassion.  They knew not what they were doing BUT they do now.  I read the book.  I found it.  Let me tell you about it…. by Nathan Winograd.  It's called Redemption.  A story of animal sheltering in the United States and it ends with the declaration of the No Kill movement.  Wow. 
<P>
The only way to stop the killing is to stop the killing. I want to make Niagara the safest place for animals.  <b>WILL YOU HELP?</b>
<P>
There are people like Jane Goodall, she understood.  She experienced her world and started to speak for those who can't speak for themselves.  That's what I am.
<P>
I'm an avenger, Charlie the avenger.  I understand cats, house cats but alley cats better.  I remember that scene in Gorillas in the mist.  Dian Fossey, she grieved so for her friend.  They took his head. Dian Fossey understood her friends; they took her life too.
<P>
You do not destroy what you value.  So I understand that we need a <A HREF=index.php?action=nokill>no kill declaration</A> for Niagara.  
<P>
Flowers to you my friends.
