	// The two lines below are all that is required to add a poll

	// a PHP code block inside a valid PHP page.  You will also need to 
	// configure the settings in config.php properly, where you will 
	// also define your polls.
	//  
	// Modify these lines as follows: 
	//
	// * Change the include path to reflect where DRBPoll is installed.  
	// * Change the parameter for show_vote_control() to reflect the unique  
	//   ID for the poll on this page.  This feature allows you to store  
	//   data for more than one poll using the same installation of DRBPoll.
	//   New polls must be added to the $VALID_POLLS array in config.php.
